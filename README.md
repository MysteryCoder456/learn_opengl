# Learn OpenGL

This repository is dedicated to tracking my journey of learning OpenGL via
[learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/).

## Code Organization

The code is organized based on the sections/chapters in the book. Each file
in `src/bin` named `section_X.rs` represents how the file looks at the end of
each chapter. There are also files named `section_X_exercise_Y.rs`, which are
my solutions to the provided chapter exercises. Aside from that, I've also
named my commits after the chapters in the book.
